# turtle-graphics-in-RISC-V

Program reads 600x50 pixels .bmp file and using parameters given in .bin file, creates a new .bmp file, using turtle graphics logic

- input.bin - contains parameters neccessary to draw a small square
- output.bmp - contains output of program operation with input.bin parameters
- original.bmp - is just an empty 50x600 .bmp file

Below are instructions that will allow for correct .bin file creation.

In order for the program to work properly, input .bin file has to follow the following format:

1. Set position command (2 word), first two bits must be 1 and 0           
The set position command sets the new coordinates of the turtle. It consists of two words. The
first word defines the command (bits 15-14) and Y (bits y5-y0, bits no. 13 - 8) coordinate of the new
position. The second word contains the X (bits x9-x0, bits no. 15 - 6) coordinate. The point (0,0) is located in
the bottom left corner of the image.

2. Set direction command (1 word), first two bits must be 1 and 1        
The set direction command sets the direction in which the turtle will move, when a move
command is issued. The direction is defined by the bits no 11 and 10. 
Each of 4 combinations of bits no. 11 and 10 set's direction:
- 00 - up
- 01 - left
- 10 - down
- 11 - right

3. Move command (1 word), first two bits must be 0 and 0       
The move command moves the turtle in direction specified by the previous command. The movement
distance is defined by the bits no 13. - 6. . If the destination point is located beyond the drawing
area the turtle should stop at the edge of the drawing. It canâ€™t leave the drawing area. 
The turtle leaves a visible trail when the pen is lowered. The color of the trail is defined by the next command. 

4. The pen state command (1 word), first two bits must be 0 and 1           
Defines whether the pen is raised or lowered (bit no. 12) and the color of
the trail. Bits no. 10 - 8 select one of the predefined colors from the color table:
- 000 - black
- 001 - purple
- 010 - cyan 
- 011 - yellow
- 100 - blue
- 101 - green
- 110 - red
- 111 - white
